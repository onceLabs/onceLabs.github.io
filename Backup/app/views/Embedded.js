          <p>onceLabs focuses on building quality user experiences between 
            people and wireless products via mobile and embedded software development. 
            We are Bluetooth Low Energy experts with a passion for uniting mobile devices and 
            embedded products over wireless interfaces.</p>
          <p>
            We offer mobile, and embedded software development, software analysis and debugging,

          <h3><Link to="/">Mobile Development</Link></h3>
          <p>We offer full mobile application development for Android and iOS. We also offer product-specific 
            Bluetooth Low Energy API development and handoff if you already have in-house mobile development 
            resources but not the expertise required to integrate BLE. In the latter case, we build robust 
            APIs for iOS and Android tailored to your specific use case.</p>

            for both mobile and embedded platforms in parallel, which gives us better design insight than companies
